# generator-ko-component [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]
> Generator for knockout.js components.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-ko-component using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-ko-component
```

Then generate your new component:

```bash
yo ko-component
```

## Description

Generator will create a folder with 2-4 files describing a component. Versions below 1.0 used to assume you use [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) as an AMD tool.
Starting from 1.0, the generator creates ES2015 modules and uses ES2015 classes.

The files are:
- HTML component template
- JS component file
- LESS stylesheet (optional)
- JS component view model file (optional)

The questions are:
- The name of the component
- Whether you want to generate LESS file
- Whether you want to create a component with view model or a template-only component
- Whether you want to create a separate file for component view model (in case you want to re-use it separately)
